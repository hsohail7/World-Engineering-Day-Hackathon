        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Extreme heat is a critical issue in refugee camps, where people face life-threatening conditions. Inadequate shelter exposes vulnerable populations, including children and the elderly, to scorching temperatures, resulting in heat-related illnesses and discomfort.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="current-situation">
        <h2>Current Situation</h2>
        <p>
            Refugee camps often consist of makeshift shelters made of materials like plastic and canvas. These materials trap heat, making the living conditions unbearable, especially during hot seasons. With climate change leading to rising temperatures, the situation is becoming increasingly perilous.

        <h2>Case Study: Dadaab Refugee Complex, Kenya</h2>
        <p>
            The Dadaab Refugee Complex in Kenya serves as a stark example of the challenges faced by refugees. The extreme heat is not merely discomfort; it poses a life-threatening risk. In the absence of suitable solutions, residents of these camps endure harsh conditions, affecting their health and well-being.

        <h2>Our Solutions</h2>
        <p>
            Innovator Duo is committed to addressing the extreme heat issue in refugee camps while aligning with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our holistic approach includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Enhanced Shelter Design:</strong> Our shelters are engineered to provide cooling and safety for inhabitants. We use advanced materials and construction techniques to create well-insulated, heat-resistant shelters.
